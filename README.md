A manufacturing company has been experiencing difficulties getting current information
from specific departments to see the current state of the plant. At certain points in the past
manufacturing had to stop due to lack of raw materials and limited space in the loading bay.
The managers from the following departments need to complete a report on a daily basis to
feed into a dashboard reporting system:

• Warehouse
• Manufacturing
• Sales
• Distribution

The department managers have to upload the xml report to a shared directory for collection
by the dashboard system. Problems have occurred in the past where changes were made to
the shared directory incorrectly and it wasn’t possible to track who made the changes. The
company’s CTO has listed the functionality they would like to include in their new business
model to offer transparency and accountability for all changes made to the shared
directory.
How the website management currently works:
The above departments are responsible for reporting on a daily basis. Reports need to be
submitted for inclusion in the daily dashboard report. Linux Managers have an account on a
Linux server, they can login and make changes to the shared directory. All changes will be
made under their user accounts. There have been disputes in the past over who is
responsible for filing reports and for reports allegedly disappearing from the shared
directory.
